# Ansible and AWS

This is a companion repository to a tutorial series on Ansible and AWS at our [iAchieved.it blog](https://dev.iachieved.it/iachievedit).

## Tutorials

* [Part 1 - Getting Started](https://dev.iachieved.it/iachievedit/ansible-and-aws-part-1/)
* [Part 2 - Variables and Facts](https://dev.iachieved.it/iachievedit/ansible-and-aws-part-2/)
* [Part 3 - Ansible Vault](https://dev.iachieved.it/iachievedit/ansible-and-aws-part-3/)
* [Part 4 - AWS RDS with Ansible](https://dev.iachieved.it/iachievedit/ansible-and-aws-part-4/)
* [Part 5 - Provisioning Users with Ansible](https://dev.iachieved.it/iachievedit/ansible-and-aws-part-5/)

## How to Use

Each part of the series builds on the next.  To see the final product of each part, switch to that branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/iachievedit/ansible-hellworld
cd ansible-helloworld
git checkout partX
```

where X is the part number (e.g., `part2`, `part3`).

The `master` branch (should) contain everything in the series thus far.

The encrypted files included in the repository should be deleted and replaced with your own.  These include `key.pem` and all of the `vault` files.

## Providing Feedback

I love feedback!  I don't know everything there is to know about Ansible (and definitely not AWS), so if you see something that could be improved upon or there's a better way to do it, please don't be shy in creating an issue against the repository.  

Thanks!
